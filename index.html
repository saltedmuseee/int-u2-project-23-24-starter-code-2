      <h2> What makes food healthy? Most of the time when people think of healthy they think of raw vegetables, or grassfed non GMO beef, but there isn't a real definition of healthy. You should just be looking for nutrient rich foods, with minimal additives and minimal processing. Most people need to just consume food that they enjoy, but with a good protein, fiber, and fat ratio. Some good websites for figuring out what works are <a href="https://www.healthline.com/">healthline, <a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/">eatingwell, <a href="https://www.nutrition.gov/about-us">and nutrition.gov! </a></a></a> </h2>

      <h2>Your heart rate should get into the "Active Zone" for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week according to the American Heart Association. So find a form of movement that you enjoy, and stay active. Exercising helps you keep your mood high, as it releases certain neurotransmitters associated with happiness, and keeps your bones strong (along with your other vital funstions). Some good websites that you can use to find a plan that works for you are <a href="https://chloeting.com/program"> Chloe ting, <a href="https://www.fitnessblender.com/">Fitness blender, <a href="https://www.nike.com/ntc-app?cid=4942550&cp=usns_aff_nike__PID_100357191_Microsoft+Shopping+%28Bing+Rebates%2C+Coupons%2C+etc.%29&cjevent=cf6c7130273f11ef826cfac90a82b82c">and Nike Training Club.</a></a></a> </h2>

      <h2>For ideal daily habits, you should start off your morning with some light stretching. Some people like to journal, others like to do breathing exercises.. but the general consensus is that you should stay off your phone for at least 15 minutes because your brain is the most pliable in the morning when your brain waves change from delta to theta waves and you wake up. Make sure to stay hydrated, wear your sunscreen, and instead of doing anything radical try to focus on making yourself 1% better everyday. Make one more good choice and build it up. Some sites that are effective for building good daily habits are <a href="https://www.ventscape.life/">Ventscape, <a href="https://productiveapp.io/?ref=blog.alexanderfyoung.com">Productive, <a href="https://habitdaily.app/?ref=blog.alexanderfyoung.com">and Habit.</a></a></a> </h2>
